# ✅ Superstore Sales Performance Analysis


## Project Overview  
This project analyzes over 9,000 sales records from a major Superstore using SQL and uncover regional revenue trends, and top-performing products. By understanding which segments, regions, and items generate the most revenue and profit, stakeholders can make smarter business decisions, optimize inventory, and identify underperforming areas.

**Research Question**: What sales patterns emerge across regions, products, and employees — and what are the revenue implications?

---

## Methodology  
- SQL queries to explore revenue, profit, and discount data across multiple dimensions.  
- Converted SQL queries into a Jupyter Notebook for interpretability and visual analysis.  
- Structured outputs to guide high-level findings and implications for retail performance optimization.

---

## Key Findings  
- **The West and East regions** lead in both total sales and average revenue per transaction.  
- **Phones and Chairs** are the top-grossing product categories, but **Tables** show a net loss.  
- Several products generate high sales volume but deliver low or negative profit margins.

## Technologies Used  
- SQLite  
- SQL  
- Python
